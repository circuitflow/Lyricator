I'm a Slave 4 U

I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too.
And I need to do what I feel like doing.
So let me go and just listen.

All you people look at me like I’m a little girl.
Well did you ever think it be okay for me to step into this world.

Always saying little girl don’t step into the club.
Well I’m just tryin’ to find out why cause dancing’s what I love.

Get it get it, get it get it (whoooa)
Get it get it, get it get it (whoooooa)(do you like it)
Get it get it, get it get it (ooohhhh)(this feels good)

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy.
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy.

What’s practical is logical. what the hell, who cares? 
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there.

I’m a slave for you. I cannot hold it; I cannot control it.
I’m a slave for you. I won’t deny it; I’m not trying to hide it.

Baby, don’t you wanna, dance upon me,
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place.
Baby, don’t you wanna, dance upon me,
(are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, my age.
(lets go)

(like that)
(you like it)
(now watch me)

Get it get it, get it get it (whoooa)
Get it get it, get it get it (whoooooa)
Get it get it, get it get it (ooohhhh)
[panting]

(I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to.
(I just feel I let myself go)

I really wanna dance, tonight with you.
(wanna see you move)

Baby, don’t you wanna, dance upon me,
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place.

Leaving behind my name, my age.
