Born Annoying

I open my mouth to talk about me
IÕll follow you around
IÕll talk about me
Boring stories, I talk about me
I never understand
Nobody wants to hear it

Born annoying

Another slow numb
Another saying
Deaf-mute dancing
I bore some lady
Let me tell you
Let me talk some
About my girl about complexion

Born annoying
