Janet Jackson
The Pleasure Principle

You might think I’m crazy but I’m serious
It’s better you know now
What I thought was happiness
Was only part-time bliss
You can take a bow

It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right, then I said wrong
Which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing
Oh my meter’s running so I got to go, now

Chorus:
It’s the pleasure principle, oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
It’s the principle of pleasure, oh-oh
It’s the pleasure principle, oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

It’s true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I’m not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It’s not the first time I’ve paid the fare
Where’d you get the idea of material possession? 
Thank you for the ride nowhere
And oh my meter’s running, so I really have to go.

Repeat chorus

I know what you mean to me
Baby this is nowhere
You what became between you and me
Human differential
It’s the principle of pleasure oh-oh oh oh oh
It’s the pleasure principle, principle
Oh ohhhh ohhhh oh

You might say that I’m no good
I wouldn’t trust your looks, baby if I could
I got too many things I wanna do before I’m through
It’s the pleasure principle, it’s the pleasure principle,
It’s the pleasure principle
Baby you can hold me down, baby you can hold me down,
After all the love that we’ve been through
After all you put me through, love me, love me
It’s the pleasure principle, yeah yeah yeah yeah
