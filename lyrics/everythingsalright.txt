Sarah Brightman
Everything's Alright

Try not to get worried
Try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you
(oh) don’t you know
Everything’s alright
Yes everything’s fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try
We’ll get by
So forget all about us tonight

Apostles’ women
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s all right yes

Mary magdalene
Sleep and I shall soothe you
Calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead
(oh) then you’ll feel
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s fine
And it’s cool and the ointment’s sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing tonight

Apostles’ women
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s all right yes

Judas (gary martin)
Woman your fine ointment
Brand new and expensive
Could have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted? 
We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry
People who are starving
Thay matter more
Than your feet and hair

Mary magdalene
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you
(oh) don’t you know
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try
We’ll get by
So forget all about us tonight

Apostles’ women
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s all right yes

Jesus (bogdan kominowksi)
Surely you’re not saying
We have the resources
To save the poor from their lot? 
There will be poor always
Pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you’ve got!
Think
While you still have me
Move
While you still see me
You’ll be lost
You’ll be so, so sorry
When I’m gone

Mary magdalene
Sleep and I shall soothe you
Calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead
(oh) then you’ll feel
Everything’s alright
Yes everything’s fine
And it’s cool and the ointment’s sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing tonight

Apostles’ women & mary magdalene
Close your eyes
Alose your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing tonight

Men
Everything’s all right
Yes everything’s all right yes
