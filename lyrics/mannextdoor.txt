Man Next Door

There is a man that live next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down...

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss an’ fight
Always a fuss an’ fight
All tru’ the night

I’ve got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I’ve got to take my family
We’ll find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans they fall
Bang against my wall
Bang against the wall
No rest at all

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss an’ fight
Always a fuss an’ fight
All tru’ the night

I’ve got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I’ve got to take my family
We’ll find a quiet place
