Joan Jett & The Blackhearts
A Little Bit of Heaven

I never told you how I feel inside
I never had the nerve
But now it’s gotten much too hard to hide
I’ll try to find the words

You make me happy
You give me pleasure
When I’m with you we’re on cloud nine
Not just the one night
With you I’m special all the time

You’re a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you’re sending
Cause with you love isn’t painful
You’re a little bit a heaven

No more pretending that there’s nothin’ here
We wasted too much time
You show me signs that make it really clear
Your motives are just fine

You made me happy
You gave me pleasure
When I’m with you we’re on cloud nine
Not just the one night
With you I’m special all the time

You’re a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you’re sending
Cause with you love isn’t painful
You’re a little bit a heaven

Yeah, throw it away baby

Now that I told you what’s been on my mind
I know just what to do
I’ll take you home tonight and hold you close
I wanna be with you

Cause you make me happy
You give me pleasure
When I’m with you we’re on cloud nine
Not just the one night
With you forever all the time

You’re a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you’re sending
Cause with you love isn’t painful

You’re a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you’re sending
Cause with you love isn’t painful

You’re a little bit a heaven
Just a little bit a heaven
You’re a little bit a heaven
