Eric Clapton
Tears in Heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven? 
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong and carry on
’cause I know I don’t belong here in heaven...

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven? 
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven? 
I’ll find my way through night and day
’cause I know I just can’t stay here in heaven...

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please...begging please

Beyond the door there’s peace I’m sure
And I know there’ll be no more tears in heaven...

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven? 
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong and carry on
’cause I know I don’t belong here in heaven...
